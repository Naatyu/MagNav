Notes:

The file contains 10Hz data recordings from magnetic sensors, inertial navigation system, avionics, electrical power

*   No altimeter data is available for some time ranges due to altitudes being greater than the range of the instrument.
**  OGS Survey mag and flown height are included for reference. The data provided here have been sampled from the original
    data as provided from the Ontario Geological Survey web pages. It is only available for portions of flight within the
    previously flown survey area.  The magnetic data grids sampled are: REMAG83.GRD for the Western ("Renfrew") section,
    and EOMAG83.GRD for the Eastern ("Eastern Ontario") section.  The height data was obtained from the OGS line database,
    then re-gridded and later re-sampled to flown lines internally by SGL.
    Flown and compiled in 2013 by Goldack Airborne Surveys.


Magnetometer/Fluxgate Definitions and Position:
Positions are defined by a vector measured from the aircraft reference point (front seat rail) to the instrument.
X is positive in aircraft fwd direction
Y is positive to port (left facing fwd)
Z is positive in up direction

Mag 1   Located in tail stinger                    (X=-12.0135, Y=0.0038, Z=1.3671)
Mag 2   Located in front cabin just aft of cockpit (X=-0.60, Y=-0.36, Z=0)
Mag 3   Located mid cabin next to INS              (X=-1.28, Y=-0.36, Z=0)
Mag 4   Located at rear of cabin on floor          (X=-3.53, Y=0, Z=0)
Mag 5   Located at rear of cabin on ceiling        (X=-3.79, Y=0, Z=1.2)

Flux B  Located in tail at base of stinger         (X=-8.92, Y=0, Z=0.96)
Flux C  Located at rear of cabin port side         (X=-4.06, Y=0.42, Z=0)
Flux D  Located at rear of cabin starboard side    (X=-4.06, Y=-0.42, Z=0)
